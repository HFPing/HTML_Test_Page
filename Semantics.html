        <h2><u>Semantic Markup</u></h2>
        <p>Let's start at what "semantic" means. According to w3schools, the word "semantic" is a descriptor for the meaning of words and phrases in a language. Applied to HTML5, this translates to descriptive words being utilized within the code in order to describe its meaning to not only the developer but also the browser/user. Examples are <i>header</i>, <i>section</i>, and <i>footer</i>: they not only invoke a setting in HTML5, but they also describe exactly what they do in their names alone.</p>
        <h2><u>Section 508 and Accessibility</u></h2>
        <p>Section 508 is a set of federal design requirements that bring accessiblity to electronic platforms for people with disabilities. "Accessibility" in this context is defined by if disabled people can use an electronic platform just as normally as those without a disability. These regulations help disabled people access integral information in a rapidly electronic-based world.</p>
        <h2><u>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</u></h2>
        <p>Search Engine Optimization are the techniques and processes that go into placing a website high on search engine results in order to maximize the number of visitors to a site. Ways SEO can be implemented on a site involve editing its HTML, page text, and coding in order to incorporate necessary key words that trigger search engine indexes.</p>
        <h2><u>How they are all related</u></h2>
        <p>All three processes are integral to implementing a concise, modern, and successful website. It makes it easily intelligible, easily accessible, and easily found all at once. All three hold websites to a higher standard than they were in the past, setting a higher precedent for website builds going into the future.</p>
